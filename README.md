# py-tminit
Userspace implementation of `hid-tminit`, requires the Python libary `pyusb`. Note that the library will have to be installed system wide, otherwise the `udev` rule will complain about not finding the module. Just run `sudo pip3 install pyusb`, should be fine.

# Installation
`sudo ./install.sh`

# Removal
`sudo ./install.sh remove`
